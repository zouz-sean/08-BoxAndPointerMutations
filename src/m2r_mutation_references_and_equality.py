"""
This module demonstrates:
 1. MUTATION of an OBJECT via a direct assignment.
 2. MUTATION of an OBJECT via a function call.
 3. Two names that REFER to the same object.
 4. Re-assigning a new to refer to a NEW object.
 5. Two equality operators:   is   ==

         their colleagues and Zhengxiao Zou.

# Students:  You will not write any code in this module,
#            but there ARE things TO DO below.
########################################################################

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DONE: 2.
#  Step a:  READ the   mutate_point   function below.
#
#  Step b:  Note that the code in main has 5 parts numbered 1, 2, ... 5.
#    ** For EACH of those 5 parts: **
#
#    Step b1:  READ the code in that part.
#
#    Step b2:  PREDICT what  the code in that part will print
#                when it runs.
#
#    Step b3:  RUN this module and examine the output from that part.
#
#    Step b4:  See whether your prediction matched the actual output.
#                Ask questions as needed to resolve any differences.
#
#    Step b5:  When you believe that you understand ** ALL ** the code
#                in this module, ** ASKING QUESTIONS AS NEEDED, **
#                change the above TO DO to DONE.
